Fun with looping array indices in Swift 2.0

Input ANY number as your array index * without * getting an 'out of bounds' error!

It slices! It *indices*!! It even makes Jul3ienne fries! 
(...see what I did there?)

((( * crickets * )))

It's also a universal Swift 2 app. So that's pretty cool :)

Happy iterating!
